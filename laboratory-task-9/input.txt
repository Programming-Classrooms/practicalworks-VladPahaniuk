Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame?
You say 1 love, 1 life
When it's 1 need in the night
1 love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it
Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
You want me to go without
Is it too late, tonight
To drag the past out into the light?
We're 1, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your bed?
Did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I've got
We're 1, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say
Love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you've got
When all you got is hurt
1 love, one blood
1 life you got to do what you should
1 life with each other, sisters, brothers
1 life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Do you hear me coming Lord?
Can you hear me call?
Hear me knockin', knockin' at your door?
Do you hear me coming Lord?
Can you hear me calling?
Feel the scratching?
Ooh you make me crawl
Thank you
